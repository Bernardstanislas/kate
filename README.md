Kill All The Enemies


To start the game, change the config file of the server to put it in 2-player mode.
Launch the server first, then two instances of our program with the following parameters:
- -ip=127.0.0.1
- -port=5555

You can add those parameters from your IDE in project/run settings.
For the second instance you should write a short script that does it.
